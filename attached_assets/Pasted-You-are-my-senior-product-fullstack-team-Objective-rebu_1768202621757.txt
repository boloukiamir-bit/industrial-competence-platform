You are my senior product+fullstack team. Objective: rebuild the current app into a “Production Leader OS” with a premium, Apple-level demo UI. Focus on ZERO-admin, day-control cockpit + people/compliance + safety culture. We will deliver in milestones with strict acceptance criteria.

TECH STACK (do not change): Next.js App Router + Tailwind + Supabase (Postgres + RLS) + existing services layer.
RULES:
- No “preview-only” screens. Everything must be clickable in the deployed environment.
- No pricing inside the authenticated app. Pricing only on public landing page.
- Every milestone must be deployed with a public URL + a test account.
- All new tables must include org_id and created_at/updated_at.
- UI must be visually premium: clean typography, spacing, subtle shadows, consistent cards, elegant empty states, smooth hover states, responsive layout.
- Use a design system: define tokens (spacing, radius, shadows, font sizes) and reuse components.

========================================
MILESTONE 1 (DEMO READY) — “TODAY COCKPIT” (5 business days max)
========================================
Deliver a new default post-login page: /app/app/cockpit (or /app/app/today). This is the main demo page.

A) PAGE LAYOUT (premium UI)
- Top header: “Today” + date + shift selector (Day/Evening/Night) + line selector (optional).
- Main grid (responsive):
  1) Top 5 Actions (most important)
  2) Staffing Status (red/yellow/green by station)
  3) Compliance Radar (expiring soon / overdue)
  4) Safety Pulse (observations + open safety actions)
  5) Plan vs Actual (can be mock for now but must look real)

B) WIDGET REQUIREMENTS
1) Top 5 Actions
- Data source: actions table (new if missing).
- Sort by: severity DESC, due_date ASC, status=open.
- One-click: mark as done; open detail drawer.
- Each action shows: title, domain (Ops/People/Safety), owner, due date, impact badge.

2) Staffing Status
- Show stations as cards in a board style:
  - Station name, assigned employee, status chip (Green/Yellow/Red), quick “suggest replacement” button (can be stub in Milestone 1).
- Status logic (simple for demo):
  - Green: assigned and compliance valid
  - Yellow: assigned but compliance expiring <=30 days
  - Red: unassigned OR overdue compliance
- Data source: stations + shift_assignments + compliance_items.

3) Compliance Radar
- List employees with items expiring within 30 days or overdue.
- Filters: All / Expiring / Overdue.
- One-click: create an action “Renew training/cert”.

4) Safety Pulse
- Show latest safety observations (last 7 days) and open safety actions.
- One-click: create observation.
- Severity levels: Low/Medium/High.

5) Plan vs Actual
- Use mock dataset for demo now.
- UI must look premium with a simple chart (Recharts ok).
- Later we connect real data; for now: display “Today plan: X / Actual: Y”.

C) AUTH + NAV
- After login redirect to Cockpit by default.
- Navigation should include:
  - Cockpit (Today)
  - Staffing Board (placeholder link ok)
  - People (placeholder link ok)
  - Competence Matrix (existing)
  - Workflows (existing)
- Remove any pricing content from logged-in area.

D) DATA
- Create seed/demo data for one org so the demo looks alive:
  - 10 employees
  - 6 stations
  - 1 shift with assignments
  - compliance items with a mix of valid/expiring/overdue
  - 8 actions (mix of Ops/People/Safety)
  - 5 safety observations

E) ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (Milestone 1)
- Deployed URL accessible.
- Login works with test account.
- Cockpit loads with real data (seeded) and zero blocking console errors.
- All buttons/drawers work (create action, mark done, create observation).
- UI is consistent, premium, responsive.
- Pricing is ONLY on landing page, never inside the app.

========================================
SQL / SUPABASE (Milestone 1) — Create these tables
========================================
Create migrations for:
- actions
- compliance_items
- stations
- shifts
- shift_assignments
- safety_observations

Also prepare placeholders for later milestones (can be created now if easy):
- rehab_cases (with RLS)
- station_role_requirements

IMPORTANT: add org_id to all new tables.

========================================
MILESTONE 2 — Staffing Board MVP
========================================
- Build /app/app/staffing as a board: stations -> assigned employees
- Add “Suggest replacement” (logic: employee has required skill level + compliance valid)
- Requires station_role_requirements + employee_skills + role_skill_requirements integration

========================================
MILESTONE 3 — People Care & Rehab (RLS)
========================================
- Build /app/app/people with:
  - Rehab board: status, next_action_date, owner, notes
  - Strict RLS:
    - HR can see all in org
    - Manager can see direct reports only
- Create actions from rehab items.

========================================
MILESTONE 4 — Safety Culture Loop
========================================
- Safety observations -> actions -> closure metrics
- “Daily safety pulse” embedded in cockpit

========================================
DELIVERY FORMAT
========================================
For each milestone deliver:
1) Deployed URL + test login credentials
2) Short changelog
3) List of migrations applied
4) Screenshots (optional)
5) Known issues (must be non-blocking)

Start now with Milestone 1. No scope creep until Milestone 1 passes acceptance.
