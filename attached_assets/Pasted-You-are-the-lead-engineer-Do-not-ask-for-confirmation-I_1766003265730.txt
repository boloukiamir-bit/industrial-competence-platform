You are the lead engineer. Do not ask for confirmation. Implement the missing MVP items and run verification. Follow the priority order below and deliver everything in one pass.

Priority 0 — Remove blockers (must be done first)
0.1 Create /signup (public)

Route: /signup

UI: same premium style as /login

Functionality: Supabase signUp with email + password

After signup:

If invite exists → user will be attached by trigger (already built)

Redirect to /app/org/select or /app/dashboard depending on org selection logic

Show clear error messages (email already registered, weak password, etc.)

0.2 Create /api/health endpoint

Route: /app/api/health/route.ts

Method: GET

Return JSON: { "status": "OK" }

This is used for uptime checks and for /health page to optionally call.

Priority 1 — Fix public pricing (must be public)
1.1 Create /pricing (public)

Move or replicate pricing content from /app/pricing to /pricing

Ensure /app/pricing is removed or redirected to /pricing

Logged-in users must never see pricing inside the app navigation

Priority 2 — Tomorrow’s Gaps (make it a true one-button demo)

Update /app/gaps to match this exact flow:

Inputs (top bar)

Date (default tomorrow)

Position/Line dropdown (required)

Shift dropdown (optional)

Button: Generate Gaps (primary)

Outputs (after click)

A) “What to fix” summary card (above table)

Employees at risk (count)

Top 3 missing skills (by frequency/severity)

“Fastest fix” suggestion (simple heuristic ok):

if someone is OK on missing skill → suggest swap

else suggest training / buddy

B) Gaps Table
Columns:

Employee

Skill

Required level

Current level

Severity badge (OK / GAP / RISK)

Suggested action (Swap / Train / Buddy / No action)

C) Export CSV

Button: Export CSV

Export exactly the table rows currently displayed

File name: gaps-YYYY-MM-DD.csv

DEMO_MODE requirement

If NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true:

Page must work without Supabase reads

Use seeded demo dataset

Make it visually rich enough to present to a customer

Priority 3 — Demo Mode Banner (make it obvious)

If DEMO_MODE is enabled:

Show a subtle banner at top of app: “Demo Mode: using sample data”

Add a link to a “Demo Script” page (see below)

Priority 4 — Testing: make Replit run a real CI command

Add scripts to package.json:

lint

typecheck

test (unit tests; minimal ok)

test:e2e (Playwright smoke)

build

ci runs: lint → typecheck → test → build → test:e2e

Minimum tests required:

Unit test: gaps severity logic returns correct status

E2E smoke:

/ loads

/login loads

/signup loads

In DEMO_MODE: /app/gaps generates table after clicking Generate

CSV export button exists and triggers download event (basic assertion)

Priority 5 — Create a “Demo Script” page (so Amir can sell)

Create /app/demo
Show 5-step script:

Login

Select org

Open Competence Matrix

Open Tomorrow’s Gaps → click Generate

Export CSV → show action plan

Final Output Requirements (must do)

After implementing everything:

Print a checklist with ✅/❌ for:

/signup works

/api/health returns OK

/pricing is public and removed from app

/app/gaps one-button flow + summary + export

DEMO banner appears

npm run ci passes

Run and paste:

npm run ci output

Provide 3 screenshots:

Landing /

Gaps page with summary + table

Pricing page

Do not ask “should I proceed”. Just do it.
