AUDIT FIX PACK — P0 SECURITY + DATA ISOLATION (NO SCOPE CREEP)

Context:
We have a multi-tenant Supabase app. Core tables use is_org_member/is_org_admin RLS helpers, but Spaljisten sp_* tables currently have RLS policies USING (TRUE). Also workflows APIs accept org_id from x-org-id header / current_org_id cookie, which is unsafe.

Goal:
1) Make Spaljisten module properly tenant-isolated (RLS) like the rest of the platform.
2) Make Workflows APIs derive org_id server-side from auth session + memberships (do NOT trust header/cookie in production).
3) Remove/disable any hardcoded org auto-seeding in migrations (keep optional manual seeding behind setup endpoint).

Hard requirements:
- Do not add new features.
- Provide a single checklist of changes + proof commands.
- All changes must be committed and pushed.

Tasks:
P0-1 Spaljisten RLS:
- Update sql/010_spaljisten_schema.sql policies:
  Replace USING (TRUE) with USING (public.is_org_member(org_id))
  Replace FOR ALL USING (TRUE) with:
    SELECT: USING (public.is_org_member(org_id))
    INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE: WITH CHECK/USING (public.is_org_admin(org_id) OR role IN ('hr')) if role exists; otherwise admin only.
- Ensure RLS enabled remains.

P0-2 Workflows org resolution:
- Create a server-side helper getOrgIdFromSession() that:
  - reads current user (auth)
  - selects org_id from memberships where status='active' (and optionally matches cookie current_org_id if exists but validate membership)
- Refactor workflows routes to use this helper instead of x-org-id/cookie as authority.
- Add a 401/403 when org cannot be resolved.

P0-3 Seeding:
- Remove auto-seed call with hardcoded org UUID.
- If needed, create a /api/workflows/setup route secured with a secret to seed templates for a specified org_id.

Definition of done:
- A non-member user cannot read/write sp_* rows.
- Workflows APIs ignore forged x-org-id.
- No hardcoded org seeding runs on migration automatically.
- Provide curl tests + short screen recording.

Output:
- List files changed
- Exact verification commands
