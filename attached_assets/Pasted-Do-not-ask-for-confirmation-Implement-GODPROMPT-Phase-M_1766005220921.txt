GODPROMPT — Phase: “Make the app understandable in 30 seconds”

You are the Product Engineer. Your goal is to remove dead ends and make the platform feel alive and sellable. Implement a guided onboarding flow, add missing CTAs, fix demo/prod data coherence, and clean up navigation.

1) Guided Setup Wizard (core deliverable)

Create /app/setup with a “Setup Progress” checklist card visible on /app/dashboard until completed.

Checklist items (each has status + button):

Create at least 1 Organization Unit → button “Create Unit”

Add employees (≥ 1) → buttons “Import CSV” + “Add Employee”

Create skills (≥ 3) → button “Add Skills”

Create position + requirements → button “Define Requirements”

Generate Tomorrow’s Gaps once → button “Generate Gaps”

Completion logic:

Persist completion in DB (org_settings table) OR in local storage for DEMO_MODE.

Dashboard shows “Setup complete ✅” once all steps pass.

2) Add “Missing Buttons” (no more dead ends)
2.1 Employees page

Add top-right actions:

Primary: “Import CSV”

Secondary: “Add Employee”
If empty:

Show an empty state card with those buttons + short guidance text.

2.2 Organization Overview page

Add top-right actions:

Primary: “Create Unit”

Secondary: “Import Org Structure (CSV)” (can be stubbed to show modal “Coming soon”)
If empty:

Show empty state with Create Unit button.

2.3 Competence Matrix page

Add top-right actions:

“Edit Requirements” (links to positions/requirements admin)

“Export Matrix CSV”
If requirements missing:

Show blocking banner: “No requirements defined yet → Define requirements to calculate risk.”

2.4 Tomorrow’s Gaps page

If no requirements OR no employees:

Show a blocking banner with one CTA:

“Go to Setup” OR “Define Requirements”
Never show “No gaps” unless it’s truly computed from valid data.

3) Navigation Clean-up (reduce confusion)

The left menu must be split into:

CORE (always usable): Dashboard, Employees, Organization, Competence Matrix, Tomorrow’s Gaps, Admin

COMING SOON (disabled/locked with tooltip): Equipment, Handbooks, Documents, News, etc.

If a page has no backend functionality, it must be in Coming soon and visually disabled.

4) Data Coherence Fix (trust killer)

In DEMO_MODE:

All pages must use the SAME demo dataset source:

same employees count everywhere

same org units everywhere

same skills/requirements everywhere
Create lib/demoData.ts and make Dashboard metrics, Employees list, Matrix, and Gaps read from it.

In production mode:

Ensure all queries are org-scoped consistently.

Fix mismatch where dashboard shows 10 but employees show 0.

5) Language Consistency

Replace Swedish text on Manager Risks page with English.
Create a single copy.ts constants file for empty-state messages to avoid mixed language.

6) Verification (must be executed)

Add a simple smoke test checklist in code comments AND run:

Navigate: dashboard → employees → organization → matrix → gaps

Verify empty states show CTAs

Verify Setup checklist updates when actions are completed

Verify DEMO_MODE shows consistent numbers on dashboard and employees page

Deliverables

/app/setup page + dashboard setup card

Buttons/CTAs added to Employees/Organization/Matrix/Gaps

Coming-soon nav grouping and disabled items

DEMO_MODE coherence via lib/demoData.ts

Language fixed (no Swedish in UI)

After implementation:

Provide screenshots of: Dashboard (with Setup card), Employees empty state (with buttons), Organization empty state (with Create Unit), Setup page.

Do not ask questions. Ship.
