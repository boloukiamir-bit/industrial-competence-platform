STOP-THE-LINE — DATA LEAK / WRONG TENANT + IMPORT FAILING (Spaljisten)

Current situation is unacceptable:
- When logging in with a NEW email, the UI still shows OLD demo data.
- Import upload throws errors.
This indicates broken tenant/org scoping OR API fallback to demo dataset.
This is a CUSTOMER TRUST KILLER. Fix this before anything else.

NON-NEGOTIABLE FIXES (in order)

1) Tenant isolation must be bulletproof (NO demo fallback):
   - Every Spaljisten page and API must be scoped by authenticated user's org_id.
   - Remove ANY fallback that returns demo data when tables are empty or org is missing.
   - If user has no org mapping, UI must show a hard error:
     "No org assigned. Contact admin." (NOT demo data)

2) Fix auth -> org mapping:
   - Ensure new users are NOT defaulted to demo org.
   - For Daniel:
     Email: daniel.buhre@spaljisten.se
     Must be customer_admin + data_owner and bound to Spaljisten org_id.
   - Do NOT require me to run SQL manually. Provide a secure admin-setup endpoint or run it yourselves.

3) Import must work end-to-end:
   - Import page: /app/spaljisten/import
   - APIs: /api/spaljisten/import
   - Provide exact validation errors in UI (row number + reason).
   - Confirm rating scale: earlier spec was 0–5, your current build says 0–4.
     Decide ONE scale and enforce it. If 0–4 is final, reject 5 with clear message.
     Treat "N" as NULL/not assessed.

4) Eliminate "old data" contamination:
   - Confirm the UI is not calling old endpoints or old tables.
   - Confirm environment variables point to the correct database.
   - Confirm no cached seed data in code.
   - Confirm RLS policies are not blocking real data while demo bypasses RLS.

5) Add a visible Tenant/Data banner to prevent silent failure:
   - At top of /dashboard show:
     org_name, org_id, dataset counts (employees/skills/ratings), last_import_at
   This makes issues instantly obvious.

DEFINITION OF DONE (must prove with screenshots/video):
- Log in with a brand new email (not in DB) -> user sees "No org assigned" message (NOT demo data).
- Log in as Daniel -> sees Spaljisten org banner + counts matching imported CSVs.
- Import succeeds for all 5 CSVs and produces an import report (inserted/updated/failed + failed rows).
- Dashboard shows ONLY Spaljisten data; no demo data anywhere.

PRIORITY: P0. Everything else is blocked until this is fixed.
